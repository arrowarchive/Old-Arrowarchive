# *Frankenstein* Variorum Reflection

I didn't know about Variorum Viewer and the Shelley-Godwin Archive until recently, and for my latest project, I read five drafts of *Frankenstein* archived within it.

The website contains the manuscript, 1818 edition, 1823 edition, Thomas edition, and 1831 editions. Before I begin, it's worth noting that the manuscript is not finished. Section 7 onwards has been published, but the previous sections have not been translated as of the time of writing this. Without further adieu, let's begin:

As I read through *Frankenstein*, I noticed several differences within the Thomas edition. This is a given, considering the history behind it, but there are numerous instances where this version is lengthier than the others. An example of this (pictured below) is from the 1818 edition, section 5. The scene describing the mountains and plains of ice is written in greater detail, but the sentences run on.
