# Corpus Analysis and Reflection

### **NOTE**: My screenshots have null space at the bottom due to my dual-screen setup. I'll provide links for *Voyant Tools*, and multiple screenshots so the *Antconc* comparisons can be read clearly.

For my latest DIGIT assignment, I used *Voyant Tools* and *AntConc* to assess William Shakespeare's *Hamlet* and Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*. Stylistic differences aside, both stories share a common theme: life and death, and how they influence the actions of others. In this essay, I will reflect on my analysis of the stories, using images and links to support my points.

### Common Ground in Different Genres

Both stories are told from a first-person perspective, meaning that "I", "Me", "My," and "And" are common among the top N-grams. In fact, between each story, the phrase "in the" (pictured below) is the top three.

### Classically Different

While many N-grams are shared between stories, their contexts are different. Viewing the Concordance tab for "in the", I found a number of differences. *Hamlet* uses the phrase the present tense, providing exposition and stage directions when it isn't spoken, while *Frankenstein* uses the phrase in the past tense, emphasizing a setting or detail and is followed by an adjective.
