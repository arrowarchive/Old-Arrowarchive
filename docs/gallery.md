* This is an image upload test on my repo. This is a doodle of a character from the *Danganronpa* series that I drew in a round of *Tee-KO*. ![omabruh](images/omabruh.png)

* I had to do a negative space project for my Digital Media/Design Class in my third year of high school. I installed a custom font and I used multicolored diamonds to show the outline of the word within the empty space (bonus points if you know why I chose the diamond colors) ![negativespace](images/negativespace.png)
