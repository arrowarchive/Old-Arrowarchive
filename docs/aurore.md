# Aurore Review

*Aurore* is an independent Adventure/Puzzle game by Reverie Forge. using environmental storytelling, it immerses the player in their adventure, similar to *Journey* and *ABZU*.  

## Gameplay
*Aurore's* gimmick is unlike anything I have played before; using the mouse buttons, the player must increase or decrease the size of the objects around them to create a path. 

## Controls
*Aurore's* concept and aesthetic serve it well, but its controls are where it falls short. The game follows the traditional WASD control scheme in addition to the space bar and mouse, but the mouse also controls the camera. Its sensitivity can be adjusted in the game's settings, but I did not notice any changes after making the adjustments. 

The game is designed as if it was meant to support an Xbox controller. The player could use the left analog stick to move, the A or B buttons to jump, control the camera with the right analog stick, and use the triggers to resize objects in their path. It would resolve the camera issue, and provide an alternative for players who are not fond of the keyboard layout.
