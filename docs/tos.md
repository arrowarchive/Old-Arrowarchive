# The-Arrowarchive Terms of Service (ToS)

The artwork on my website is issued under Creative Commons License CC BY-NC 4.0, which states that my work can be shared in any medium or format so long as I am credited for the original work. This also means that my work cannot be used commercially. I will detail these more on the page, so read carefully. 

## Distribution of My Work/Where to Find Me

* My *Twitter*: [@arrowarchive](https://twitter.com/arrowarchive)

* My (privated) *Instagram*: [arrowpen_archive](https://www.instagram.com/arrowpen_archive/)

* My *Discord*: **Arrowarchive** 

These websites, alongside *GitHub*, are my social media outlets. I do not have pages on *Deviantart*, *Tumblr*, *Pinterest*, *Wattpad*, etc. If you see an account with the Arrowarchive name under any of those platforms, they are not me, and there is a way to prove it: 

* **All my accounts have the same profile picture-** If any account bears the name but does not have my picture, then it is not me. If they are using my profile picture, then report it to me immediately. It is a drawing I had commissioned, and it can only be used by me (the artist is credited in the website's FAQ)

## Redistribution/Sharing My Work

1. **Reposting my art on other platforms is forbidden under all circumstances-** Asking permission and saying that you will give credit will not change my mind. Reposting art takes attention away from the original artist, and even if credit is provided, few people will care enough to visit the artist's website. It's an unfortunate truth, and if you want to support me, it is best that you support me directly. This means following me on *Twitter* and spreading the word about this page. 

* If my art is posted under an account that isn't my own, **report it to me immediately**. Even if credit is given, the art was posted without my consent and I will issue a takedown on the picture. While I encourage that people inform me of reposting, I do not condone harrassing or threatening the person in question until they take it down. Inform me privately of the issue, and I will attempt to resolve it peacefully.

2. **Removing my watermark is not permitted-** Watermarks are a form of protection for an artist. I'm discreet with my watermarks, but removing them and advertising the work as your own is strictly forbidden. If this does occur, let me know immediately. I'm less tolerant of people who remove my watermark, and I will be less forgiving when discussing the subject. 

3. **Quote-Retweeting or including my work in a Fleet is prohibited-** This is specific to *Twitter* users. Quote-Retweeting creates a post under the sharer's account the prevents likes, comments, and constructive criticism from reaching the artist. I disapprove of fleets for a similar reason, but unlike *Instagram* stories, the artist will not be informed of this and the viewer cannot be directed to the artist's page (If *Twitter* changes how fleets are formatted, then I may change my stance on this policy).

* Due to changes in *Twitter's* interface, a retweet takes the form of a blank QRT. While QRT's are a nuisance, retweets are greatly appreciated, as they share my work and ensure that I will receive any feedback on the piece.

## Non-Commercial Use Policy

Creative Commons states that **others cannot use my work for commercial purposes**. This means that others are not allowed to use my work for profit unless they have approval. With that said, I have one exception to this rule: **commissions**. My stance on commissions is that despite paying an artist to draw something, the work counts as non-commercial. Everything I commission is intended for personal use, so commissioning a drawing of an original character is essentially granting permission to draw the character as long as it is not used commercially. With that said, I have one rule for artists I commission:

* **If my commission includes an original character and the artist wants to share it online, I must be asked about it and credited for the initial design.** I appreciate that artists I've commissioned do this already, but I'm not opposed to the drawing being shared as long as I am asked about it beforehand and that I am tagged/mentioned if I approve.
