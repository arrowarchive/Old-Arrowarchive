# The-Arrowarchive Terms of Service (ToS)

You might be wondering why this page is here. Well, it is not in place yet, but it because I will apply a *Creative Commons* license to this website soon, and I wanted to create a page in advance that will detail the terms of service for my artwork and its distribution. Once it is implimented, I will add more to this. Once I establish my terms of service, I'll be happy to answer any questions people have for me.

(Also, because I am applying a *Creative Commons* website to this page, it does not mean I will remove art from my *Twitter*. Usually, my art is posted to *Twitter* first, and then I archive it here. Thank you for understanding)
