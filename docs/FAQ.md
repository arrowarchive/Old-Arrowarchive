# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

* Why do you go by "The Arrowarchive?"

**Arrowarchive is the name I post my art under. I wanted to keep my username the same across multiple platforms, but my previous alias was taken. Because of that, I changed my alias to Arrowarchive, as a "Archive of Arrowpen's Art", and I've posted under that name ever since!**

* What program do you draw with?

**I draw with *Clip Studio Paint* on iOS. I have two years of experience with the PC version, but I switched with to the iPad version in June.**

* What are your favorite things to draw?

**I love drawing characters! I've designed several of them, and about 95% of my drawings are characters I have made. I draw fan art occasionally, but not very often.**

* Will you post your art here?

**Possibly. I'm new to *GitHub*, so I'm figuring out the program. If I can create a page to post my art, then I will.**

* What programs do you recommend for someone who is new to Digital Art?

**I recommend *Clip Studio Paint*, but it has a learning curve so I'd suggest using the free trial before deciding if you should buy it. I also recommend *Paint Tool SAI*, *Pixlr*, and *Medibang*, as I've heard great things about each of them.**
