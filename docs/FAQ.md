# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

* Who made your profile picture/PFP?

**My profile picture was made by an artist known as *310v3* on *Twitter*! I commissioned him to draw an icon of Aqua, one of my OCs, in his style, and it is absolutely adorable! I highly recommend that you check out his work** 

* Why do you go by "The Arrowarchive?"

**Arrowarchive is the name I post my art under. I wanted to keep my username the same across multiple platforms, but my previous alias was taken. Because of that, I changed my alias to Arrowarchive, as a "Archive of Arrowpen's Art", and I've posted under that name ever since!**

* What program do you draw with?

**I draw with *Clip Studio Paint* on iOS. I have two years of experience with the PC version, but I switched to the iPad version in June.**

* What are your favorite things to draw?

**I love drawing characters! I've designed several of them, and about 95% of my drawings are characters I have made. I draw fan art occasionally, but not very often.**

* Will you post your art here?

**Possibly. I'm new to *GitHub*, so I'm figuring out the program. If I can create a page to post my art, then I will.**

* What programs do you recommend for someone who is new to Digital Art?

**I recommend *Clip Studio Paint*, but it has a learning curve so I'd suggest using the free trial before deciding if you should buy it. I also recommend *Paint Tool SAI*, *Pixlr*, and *Medibang*, as I've heard great things about each of them.**

* What will you be posting here?

**As of the time I'm writing this (09/17/2020), I plan to post projects from my previous art/design classes, and gradually work my way up to my more recent works.**

* May I repost your art? 

**NO! you are not allowed to repost my work, even if you say you will give me credit. I have/will link my Twitter account to the Github page, so if you want to share my work, please follow me there and retweet my work. Reposting is not allowed, but retweeting is greatly appreciated.**

* I have seen your work posted on someone else's account. What should I do?

**I hope this doesn't happen, but in the event that my work is reposted on someone else's *Instagram*, *Twitter*, *Pinterest*, *DeviantArt*, etc, please send me a message on *Twitter* and give me the name of the account. I will go from there to ensure that the post is taken down. In the event that someone reposts my work AND removes my signature, that is something else entirely. But please, if you see my work reposted anywhere that is NOT my *Instagram*, *Twitter*, or my other websites, please let me know!**
