# Harxol

I set a challenge for myself last year where I had to complete a drawing with as few outlines as possible. The end result was a character with several traits that deviate from my style, yet a character whose design I am really fond of.

This is Harxol, an alien character with a semi-futuristic design. His name is derived from the words "heart" and "crystal", which are prevalent in his design.
