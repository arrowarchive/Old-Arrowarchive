In 2019, I challenged myself to complete a drawing with as few outlines as possible. The end result was a character with several traits that deviate from my style, yet I'm really fond of him.

This is Harxol, an alien character with a somewhat futuristic design. His name is derived from "heart" and "crystal", which should be obvious. I want to draw him again someday, since I have other aliens I want to design and one of them is robotic like him. It would be fun to draw them together, but I need to design the other character first.

**Completion Date: 2019**
