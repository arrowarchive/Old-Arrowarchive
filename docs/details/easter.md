Happy Easter Everyone!

I've had a lot of work and less time to draw, but I made an Easter drawing and I finished it early... somehow. I can't explain that. I had to wait over a week to share this, but it was better to start and finish early than wait and finish late.

I wanted to add more to add more to this, but I felt like designing the eggs was enough. From left to right, they are based on my characters and the projects they came from; There's Kesshō's egg decorated with rabbits and crystals (*Unfamiliar*), Aqua's egg with polka dots and the signature star (*SPACE Warriors*), and Lylatt's egg decorated with the symbols of her friends (*Joyride*).

These eggs took a lot of effort to design, but they were worth it. I hope they work well with the pastel background/effects, and the picture appeals to the eye. I hope you have a Happy Easter if you celebrate it, and if you don't, I hope you have a great day!
