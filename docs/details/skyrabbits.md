When *Pokemon Sword and Shield* was in development, I had a conversation with a friend about Scorbunny's type. He insisted it would be another fire/fighting type, and I said it would be cool to see a fire/fairy type. He asked what that would look like, and I drew it. What was supposed to be a fire/fairy rabbit evolved into something new.

The first picture is the original rabbit design from 2019, and the second picture is a redesign I did this summer. Their names, from left to right are **Kumo** (雲), **Kesshō** (結晶) and **Kōri** (氷), Japanese for **cloud**, **crystal**, and **ice** respectively.

I love their designs, and I need to draw them more. For now, enjoy this piece I made!
