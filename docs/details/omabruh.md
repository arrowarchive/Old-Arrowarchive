# Tester Image

This is an image test. This is a doodle of Kokichi Oma from the *Danganronpa* series that I drew in a round of *Tee-KO*.

For those who don't know, *Tee-KO* is a minigame in *The Jackbox Party Pack 3* where each player must create a Tee-Shirt using the drawings and slogans that other players have made. The results are hilarious.
