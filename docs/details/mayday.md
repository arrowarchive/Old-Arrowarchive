My first drawing of the sky rabbits featured Kesshō and her evolution line, but after listening to "Mayday" by *TheFatRat*, I was inspired to draw her again. 

This time, it's a yin and yang-like drawing featuring Kesshō and her counterpart, **Mayonaka** (真夜中), whose names translates to **midnight** in Japanese. She's a similar species of rabbit, but with different powers compared to Kesshō. I like her design, so I need to draw her again later. 

That said, I love how the midnight/sunrise contrast on this piece turned out! It took a while, but I'm very proud of it!
