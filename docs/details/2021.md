After the chaos that was 2020, I was ready to kick off 2021 on a high note; sketching this on New Year's Eve and finishing it on New Year's Day, I've decided to make Aqua and Kessho the mascots of my portfolio. 

I redesigned Kessho just before drawing this and I'm happy with how she looks (especially since I gave her a more detailed look on the front page). My only other note with the piece is I'm surprised *Clip Studio* doesn't have any confetti brushes. I had to find one myself, and I'm really happy with how it looks!

I know I didn't post an entry for this when it premiered, but I wanted to wait until the New Year passed to write about it. I hope you enjoy my thoughts on this!
