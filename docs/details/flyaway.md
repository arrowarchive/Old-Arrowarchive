# Fly Away

A new character design I came up with, and one I've had in mind for a long time (though it was mostly an excuse to practice with *Clip Studio's* glow and blur effects), I've wanted to draw a human/dragon hybrid for months, but I didn't have time to work on it until recently. I'm happy with how she turned out, but I think that she'll get a redesign later.

I was going to focus on her design initially, but after a while, I decided to add a background. The result turned out fantastic; the moon is my favorite part, the clouds look decent, and the stars are the piece de resistance. Even if my thoughts on the design are mixed, I'm proud of myself for experimenting with this one, and I hope to work with backgrounds more in the future!

(That's supposed to be the capricorn sign on her hand, btw. If I draw her again, I'll explain why it's there)
