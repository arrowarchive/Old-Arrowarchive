# Album Recreation Assignment

One project from my Digital Media/Design class was to recreate an album cover using pictures of animals. For this project, I chose to recreate *Queen's* album "Hot Space", using cats and dogs. Here is a comparison of the original cover (top) and my recreation (bottom)
