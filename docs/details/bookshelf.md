I dabbled in furniture design over the Summer. I drew a layout for an ocean-themed room, and several items that go with it. The oldest design in this collection is a bookshelf. It's royal blue with gold-pink, and silver accents, decorated with sand dollars of various sizes. I have more designs in this collection, which I will upload later.
