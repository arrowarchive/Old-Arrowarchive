The ocean desk is one of my favorite items in the set so far. It's based on my desk, which has a removable filing cabinet containing two drawers and a gap above them. I wanted the ocean influence to be more noticeable, so I added a seahorse design on the side, bubbles on the corners, a seaweed handle, a golden seaweed handle, and pearl drawer pulls. 

I have one more item that I have designed for the set, and I will finish the rest of it at a later date.
