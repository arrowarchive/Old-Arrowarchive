A few years ago, I had an assignment where I had to design an a creature with the characteristics of three or more animals; a hybrid, if you will. 

I wanted to try that challenge again, but I wanted them to be a biped instead of a quadruped; in otherwords, I wanted them to be anthropomorphic. 

After working on-and-off for over a week, this was the result; a hybrid shapeshifter with characteristics that don't clash. The hererochromia and asymmetrical top were added at the last minute, and all of Lylatt's components are listed below:

* Kitsune (multiple tails, shapeshifting abilities)
* Griffin (the wings and talons)
* Chimera (to an extent)
* Sheep
* Cat

Designing her was as fun as it was difficult; incorporating her elements and designing a color palette that didn't clash took the most thought, especially since she isn't bound by reality. It was fun designing her, but I feel like it will be a while before I try this challenge again.
