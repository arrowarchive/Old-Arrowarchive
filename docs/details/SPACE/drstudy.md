Earlier this year, I did a pose study and used some models from the *Danganronpa* series as a reference. The characters are very expressive and they are good for practicing anatomy.

I chose Shadow and Electra for this study, and I used sprites from Akane Owari in *Danganronpa: Goodbye Despair* and Kokichi Oma in *Danganronpa V3* as references. 

The expressions suited their characters, and I got a better grasp on the hands from this exercise. As a bonus, this was my first full-body drawing of Electra's redesign, and I'm really happy with how it turned out! I've used that design ever since, plus or minus the goggles on his head.

* The sprites for Akane and Kokichi I referenced can be found **[here](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/danganronpa/images/8/8b/Akane_Owari_Halfbody_Sprite_%288%29.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/752?cb=20170819153506)** and **[here](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/danganronpa/images/9/94/Danganronpa_V3_Kokichi_Oma_Fullbody_Sprite_%288%29.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/538?cb=20180506070916)**
