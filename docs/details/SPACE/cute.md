# Halloween 2020

     I designed a character a while back who looks cute, but is a terrifyingly powerful magician with a short fuse. I wanted to draw her again, but with Halloween on the horizon, I thought "Why not combine the two?". With that thought, this drawing was born. 
 
I hope you enjoy, and Happy Halloween!!!
