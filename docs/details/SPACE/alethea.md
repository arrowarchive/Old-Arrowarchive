Another character black, white, and grey character design for February... Is this gonna be a pattern? probably not.

I've had this design in mind for a while; I figured out everything for her except for her look. After experimenting with *Clip Studio's* 3D models and browsing "Create-a-Sim" in *The Sims 4*, I started working on her design. I did this all in one day (much like Ember), and I'm proud of the result. Pink Pearl from *Steven Universe* also influenced her design, but that doesn't matter as much. 

On a side note, I'm gonna experiment with *CSP's* 3D models more. I got the pose right and I'm happy with her hands and feet (two areas I struggle with), but I feel like her arms and legs are too long. The models have realistic proportions, so I may adjust them slightly to fit my style better. That, and I'm going to find a way to position the models so they won't take up the whole page. The perspective tools as a whole are an experiment, but I am slowly making them work.
