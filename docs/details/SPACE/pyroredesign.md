Early in 2020, I gave one of my characters--Pyro-- a redesign. He originally wore a white gi with a red belt, but after learning about Wushu, I redesigned Pyro to have him wear one of their uniforms and iron out some of his features. 

Later versions of his design include an emblem on the shirt and I've drawn him with sandals, but this was the concept drawing for his current look. The darker shades of red and gold mesh well with his skin tone, so I hope I can keep using this design going forward!
