I got an iPad in June of 2020, and I couldn't wait to draw with it! I ordered some screen protectors, downloaded *Clip Studio*, and after a few days, I hit the ground running! my first drawings were of Aqua, Electra, Shadow, and Chlora, characters who I was the most confident drawing at the time. 

Looking back, My style has changed significantly; my lines were thicker and Chlora's hair is different, but these were quick drawings (by my standards, anyway). This was a good test run for my iPad and its version of *Clip Studio*, and I was ready to switch after using the PC version two years prior.
