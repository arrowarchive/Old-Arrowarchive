# Casual Discussion

This drawing was a work-in-progress I was sitting on for a while. I was listening to "No Reason to Lie," a song by *Give Heart Records*, and while I was watching the music video, one of the characters was sitting in a chair as if she were judging the others. I used [that moment](https://youtu.be/oZ-51rj2_WI?t=118) as the foundation for this picture. 

I chose Shadow because she's the most intimidating. Because of her past, she views kindness as a weakness and uses aggression to hide it. Her ego masks her insecurities, and her behavior is off-putting to others unless they know her. That is not why I held off on this for so long, however...

...It's because I had trouble with her hair. Her hair goes down to her knees, and I didn't know how to make her sit down without her hair covering the chair. It took a while, but I think I figured it out. Unlike Aqua, whom has waist-length hair, Shadow was a lot harder to draw. 

Much like the discussion piece, this is my second experiment with perspective. I'm keeping the furniture minimal, but I like putting my old artwork on the walls of the house. It's a nice easter egg for those who have stuck around for long enough.
