Remember my Halloween drawing? the person pictured is Nihilus, a character I designed earlier this year. Beneath her childish exterior is a powerful mage with a short fuse. In her initial design (pictured above), she had less detail in her clothes and the suits were a lot larger.

Her Halloween design is cleaner and more refined, but I want to share the concept design. My style has evolved this year, and this is an example of it.
