I listen to music when I draw, and one song "I Can't Fix You" by *The Living Tombstone*, caught my attention. There was one scene where four characters were shown in silhouette, which inspired me to draw it with five of my characters. I'll post more about them eventually, but this is how I will introduce them here. 

I do not have permission to share the video, but you can visit the channel **[here](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheLivingTombstone/featured)**

* If you want to see the video, I'll warn you: **the video contains flashing lights and images, which may not be suitable for photosensitive viewers.** There are other videos featuring the song without the animation, but viewer discretion is advised (I'm stating this because it's listed in the video's description, but I don't know who pays attention to video descriptions nowadays).
