"When one era ends, another one begins, and two kingdoms will rise from the ashes..."

I've wanted to draw a fusion character for a long time, but I shelved the idea when I redesigned one of their components. I decided to give the design another shot when I found a sketchbook from two years ago containing their design. After a little thought, I decided to give their design another shot, and I'm really proud of it!

Their dress is inspired by Pyrope's from *Steven Universe: Unleash the Light* who has a similar skirt that shows off her legs. The hair, on the other hand, was all my idea; I thought Shadow's hair was the craziest hair I've drawn so far, but this is giving her a run for her money.
