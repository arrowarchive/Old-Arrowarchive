# Jacket

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arrowarchive/The-Arrowarchive/master/docs/images/SPACE/jacket.PNG" onContextMenu="return false;"/>]()

I drew a character in a new outfit. Why? because I wanted to. I haven't drawn Shadow since September, and I drew her with a new outfit in mind.

I imagined her wearing a leather/pleather jacket with spikes on the shoulders, a black choker, and a red shirt. She pulls it off, but I like her main outfit too much to make this her default. I may consider removing the long strip of hair on her right shoulder, but it's because it's inconvenient to draw sometimes. 

I've been drawing less and recently, but there's a reason behind it. I'll explain that in the future.
