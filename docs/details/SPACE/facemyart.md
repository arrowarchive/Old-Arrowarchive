# Face My Art

Earlier this year, there was a trend tagging on *Twitter* called #faceyourart. Having drawn a lot earlier in the year and witnessing my friends take part in the tag, I thought "Why not? I can do this too". This is my take on the challenge and what's on the front page of my blog (though that's subject to change)

I can't believe all of these drawings were made this year. I don't know where the time went, but it was time well spent!
