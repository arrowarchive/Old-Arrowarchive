I love the mermaid set in *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*, so when I learned that they added clothes to the series, I was ecstatic! After obtaining a few of the items, I looked up what the rest of them looked like, and to my surprise, there was a pink palette for the clothes! 

I wanted to draw one of my characters wearing the outfits, but I couldn't decide on the colors. Ultimately, due to Aqua's palette, I made her wear the pink clothes. It was fun to work on, and I don't draw my characters wearing fun outfits as much as I should. Maybe I should fix that.
