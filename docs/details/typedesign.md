One assignment for my Digital Media/Design class was to design six text graphics. This assignment taught me that *Clip Studio Paint* and *Adobe Photoshop* are compatible programs, and I spent the next several weeks comparing the programs to learn more about them.

It was a fun project, and what I learned from it helped me later down the line.
