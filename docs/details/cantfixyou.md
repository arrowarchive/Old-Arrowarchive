I listen to music when I draw and one song "I Can't Fix You" by *The Living Tombstone*, caught my attention. There was one scene where four characters were shown in silhouette, which inspired me to redraw it with five of my characters. I'll post more information about these characters eventually, but this is how I will introduce them. 

I do not have permission to share the video here, but the song is catchy and the video is well animated. 

* If you want to see the video, I'll provide a quick warning: **the music video contains flashing lights and images, which may not be suitable for photosensitive viewers.** There are other videos featuring the song without the animation, but viewer discretion is advised.

(Hopefully this commit works)
